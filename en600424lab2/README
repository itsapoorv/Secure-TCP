Network Security Lab 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only files need for RIP protocol is RIP.py, lab2stack, and 
    lab2module.conf
CertFactory created, but only works locally, as specified on Piazza
    RIP also depends on CertFactory.getRootCert, specified in follow-up 
    discussion


It follows the updated RIP protocol specified on piazza and in the PRFC.
- The window size is 1, and not adjustable
- In data transmission if authentication fails, drop the packet
- If an unexpected SNN is received the connection is terminated
- Connection timeout is 2 minutes with no new messages sent and no
    authentic messages received.
- Reset flag is never sent and ignored it received
- If the server receives an authentic, unexpected SNN it will shutdown
    and moves to the "QUESTIONING" state
- The maximum number of messages that can be sent without receiving an 
    acknowledgement is 256, any new messages received from the higher
    layer are stored (in order) for later transmission
- Likewise the maximum number of messages that can be received out of
    order is 256, after that any out of order messages will be dropped
- Maximum segment size is 4096
- Acknowledgement messages do not increase the sequence number
- Messages are retransmitted after 4 seconds
- Each message has its own retransmission timer.
- All handshake messages increase the sequence number by 1
